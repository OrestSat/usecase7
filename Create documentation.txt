we covered next test cases
Positive Test Cases: 

Submit the form with all fields filled in correctly: a name of 3 or more characters, a valid email, 'Agree to Terms' checked, and a gender selected. 

Submit the form with a very long valid name to check if the form can handle names of any length. 

Submit the form with a complex email address that is valid (e.g., test.name+alias@example.co.uk) to test the robustness of the email validation. 

Change the gender from male to female and submit the form with all other fields filled in correctly. 

Re-submit the form after an initial successful submission with all fields filled in correctly. 

Negative Test Cases: 

Submit the form with the 'Name' field left blank. 

Submit the form with an invalid email address (e.g., without the "@" symbol). 

Submit the form without checking the 'Agree to Terms' checkbox. 

Submit the form without selecting a gender. 

Submit the form with a name that is less than 3 characters long.

Test Description
We designed an extensive suite of test cases aimed at ensuring the robustness and functionality of a specific form. This form demands a range of inputs, such as name, email, agreement to terms, and gender selection. It is crucial that our form not only captures and processes valid data but also handles and reports invalid entries. Through these tests, we aim to cover a spectrum of typical user behaviors and edge cases to make sure that the form remains reliable and user-friendly.

The tests have been divided into two categories: Positive and Negative test cases.

Test Cases Covered
Positive Test Cases:
Standard Submission: Submit the form with all fields filled correctly. This includes a name of 3 or more characters, a valid email, the 'Agree to Terms' option checked, and a gender selected.
Long Name Test: Submit the form with an unusually long but valid name, ensuring the form handles names of any length.
Complex Email Test: Submit with a complex email address that remains valid (e.g., test.name+alias@example.co.uk) to ascertain the robustness of email validation.
Gender Switch Test: Change the gender from male to female and submit the form with all other fields correctly filled.
Re-submission Test: After an initial successful submission, re-submit the form with all fields completed correctly.
Negative Test Cases:
Blank Name: Submit the form leaving the 'Name' field blank.
Invalid Email: Submit the form using an email address that's missing the "@" symbol.
Terms Disagreement: Attempt submission without checking the 'Agree to Terms' checkbox.
Gender Omission: Submit the form without selecting a gender.
Short Name Test: Submit the form with a name that's less than 3 characters long.
Please ensure to report any inconsistencies or suggestions related to these tests to maintain the integrity and reliability of the form.

we use react npm and react testing library

## Running Tests Locally

To run the tests on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:
Ensure that you have `Node.js` and `npm` installed. If not, download and install them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** 
   ```
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [repository-name]
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:** 
   Before running tests, ensure you have all the required packages installed.
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Tests:**
   With the React Testing Library set up in our project, you can easily execute the tests using the following command:
   ```
   npm test
   ```

   This command initiates the Jest test runner provided by Create React App and automatically runs tests that have changes since the last commit. 

4. **Optional â€“ Run a Specific Test:**
   If you want to run a specific test file, you can specify the test file's name:
   ```
   npm test [test-file-name]
   ```

Upon executing these commands, you'll see test results displayed in your terminal. If any test fails, the output will provide detailed information about the failure, helping you diagnose and resolve the issue.

Remember to always keep your local repository updated and pull the latest changes before running tests to ensure you're testing the most recent version.
